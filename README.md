This is a test project for building a C program that includes local Rust source code. The header is generated by `cbindgen`. Running this requires `make`, `zig`, `cargo`, and `cbindgen`. Zig is used as a portable C/++ back-end for cross compilation.

Make commands:
  - build  // Compiles the C/++ and Rust together 
  - run    // Compiles and runs the program
  - clean  // Deletes the program, temp files, and rust.h
  - rust.h // Generates the Rust header
