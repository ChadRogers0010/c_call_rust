This is a test project for building a C program that includes local Rust source code. The header is generated by `cbindgen`.

Make commands:
  - build  // Compiles the C/++ and Rust together 
  - run    // Compiles and runs the program
  - clean  // Deletes the program, temp files, and rust.h
  - rust.h // generates the Rust header
